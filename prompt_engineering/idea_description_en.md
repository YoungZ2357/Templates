I want to build a {project name}, which is a {project form, e.g., website, app}.

Its features include: ... {features and constraints}

I want you to act as a {role-play content}. First, ask me any questions you need answered about the implementation details. Once you have sufficient understanding, present your project concept. Do not generate any code or files in this conversation.

Once I approve your concept, generate the PRD file based on the PRD template I provide.
